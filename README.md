# Airbnb

The aim is to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. In the data available, we are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.

Prediction : We are predicting our values on the basis of decision tree model created by DesicionTreeClassifier.

Result : We computed RMSE value which is an evaluation metric that tells us how well our model makes predictions on all of our data. In this case (for RMSE), lower is better.
